Huffman coding is a compression algorithm used to reduce the size of files. 
It assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies.
More frequent characters get shorter codes, and less frequent characters get longer codes.
This technique is widely used in various applications such as data transmission, file storage, and image compression.
Using Huffman coding can significantly reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored or transmitted.
