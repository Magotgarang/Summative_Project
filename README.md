# Summative Projects

This repository contains multiple C programming projects that demonstrate various algorithms and data structures. The projects include functionalities for graph algorithms, compression techniques, contact tracking, a simple dictionary, student records management, and a to-do list application.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Dijkstra's/Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Implements Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford algorithms for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.
- Users can input the graph's edges and choose which algorithm to execute.

### 2. Huffman Coding
- Implements Huffman coding for compressing data based on character frequency.
- Allows the user to compress a file and display the generated Huffman codes.

### 3. Criminal Tracking Based on Contact
- Implements a graph to track contacts of individuals based on user input.
- Uses Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse and display contacts.

### 4. Simple Dictionary Application
- A simple dictionary that allows users to add words and their meanings, search for words, and display all entries.

### 5. Student Records Management System
- Manages student records, allowing users to add student information and display all records.

### 6. Simple To-Do List Application
- A to-do list application that allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and display the list of tasks.

## How to Run the Projects
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`).
3. Run the executables generated to interact with each project.
